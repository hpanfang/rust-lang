/*
Rusts standard library includes a number of useful data structures called collections.
Collections can contain multiple values, and are stored on the heap. This means the amount
of data does not need to be known at compile time and can grow or shrink as the program runs.

Three very common collections are:
-vectors: allow you to store a variable number of values next to each other
-string: a collection of characters. weve mentioned it previously but will now cover
it in depth
-hash map: allows you to associate a value with a particular key. Its a particular implementation
of a more general data structure called a map.
